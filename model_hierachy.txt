* Nozzles and arrive/leave
1) If no action, first nozzle is arrive, second nozzle is leave
2.a) If a nozzle has a name that contains string ARRIVE it will define the arrive size
2.b) If a nozzle has a name that contains stirng LEAVE it will define the leave size
3) If the nozzle has a name that ends in P#x, where x is  number 1,2,4,5,6,7 the nozzle will have that ppoint (1=arrive, 2 = leave)

Nozzle geometry is not imported, only connection information. For flanged valves, model a cylinder the same size as the nozzle.
